1. Obviously my opinions about Google Code,are in a positive directions.
I think that it helped a lot to our group members when developping our
project. First of all it served us as a "shared repository",which is a 
very important aspect in developping a group project. Secondly , the 
fact that google code supports wiki , was a very benefitial feature to 
everyone in the group. To conclude, I think that I will use Google Code 
in my career very often, since it is very practical and comprehensible.

2. I think that it is a very interesting project. Actually I think that it
is so because It was my first group project experience, which is very
different from solo project experience. Besides, this project seemed to me
as an easy one in the beggining of the semester, but as we go deeper
and deeper, it made me think a lot, especially at the requirements phase.
Lastly i can say that, this project is a valuable and very useful one.

3. Yes I would like to work in this project in Cmpe 451.

4. Of course I feel that I gained some idea about the tools and approaches
used in software engineering. If I rephrase it in other words, I can say
that, by this time on I started to feel as if I'm really becoming an
engineer!
