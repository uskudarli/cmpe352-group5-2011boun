1. It is definitely easy to use and understand. Everything is well placed and organized.
You can find almost every kind of resources, tools and other stuff related to software developing.
In terms of the project we have been working on, I can say that Google Code helped especially 
in terms of being organized and well documented.

2. The project we have been working on is a really interesting and nice one. I think it is
an extendible project; it can get related to other subjects easily. From the point of learning
software engineering fundamentals, it is a nice project since it helped me a lot to grasp the ideas.

3. Yes, I would like to work on this project in CMPE 451. Because I would like to finish what I
started. And more importantly, it would be nice to continue working on such a project that will help
people.

4. Yes, I have gained some idea about the tools and approaches used in software engineering.
Most importantly, I got the idea that it is more than just writing the code and a document
describing it. I learned some of the important tools used in software engineering like Google Code,
fundamental ideas and approaches about management and planning and other
fundamental things in software engineering.
