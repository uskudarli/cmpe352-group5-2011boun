In some situations like subway systems etc. we are not interested in geographical distributions of our travel locations( I don't mind the subway making a huge zig-zag, if it goes where I want, do you?). Here we are gathered to create a solution to make creation of schematized maps possible with no effort at all. We are a bunch of solution-oriented crazy people, who try to make some business simpler( And to do that we use SWE paradigms naturally, as we are all computer engineering students).
