1. Google Code is a well designed project management environment that covers up 
all aspects of our project in cmpe352. It's very simple to learn & use.

2. Our project is a well-built project, covers most of the issues up to implementation.
We have a good project topic and our efforts to build is satisfactory, in my opinion.

3. Absolutely yes.

4. I guess I do. Until taking this course, my project management approach was  
to maintain source code and documentation. This course taught me other aspects
of project management, such as design documents, issue tracking etc. I gained 
experience using tools such as GoogleCode and MsVisio in such new(for me) project
management aspects.
