1. I think googlecode is very helpful when we create this project.We use wiki and we all can update this pages.
In issue part we assign ourself some tasks and see their progress.So, when developing open source project googlecode should be used.

2.Our project requires very detailed work in requirements and design.In the second term(Cmpe 451) especially algorithmic aspects will be hard. In addition to that,
I found our project very practical in real life.  

3.Yes,I want.

4.In this course we learned about practical life software engineering.We learned that requirements and testing are very important in real life.When they are not
properly they cause important problems. Also working with people is a real practice. In Real life project groups this experience will help us.I learned how to use 
GoogleCode.
