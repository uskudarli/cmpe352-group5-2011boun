1. Google code helped our team to be more organized when we are preparing the requirements and design of 
the project. It has many useful tools that are necessary for software engineering and development. We were
able to follow the stages of our work easily. Wiki pages served as a good documentation place. The issues page
is where we could report issues and track them. We did not use the source page of google code except the 
final small code we added lastly, so I can not say much about it. The downloads page is where we have shared 
necessary material for the project.

2. Our project was the "Schematizing Maps". It was interesting project; I have never thought of getting these
maps with a software. Looking at the project in terms of its contributions to our course it study, it served well
to learn real life issues of general workflow of a software project.

3. No. This was an interesting project but what I would like to work on a project about computer graphics.

4. I think I now have the general knowledge and practice of early desing stages of the software development.
I have the insight of common project planning activities and problems that may arise. The develoment
practice is left to 451.
