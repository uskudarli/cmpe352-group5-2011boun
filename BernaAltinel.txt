1.  I think using Google Code was very helpful for our team work.
•	Because every member of the team can see what is going on the  project, what are files created, what are their contents and anyone can make her/his updates easily.
•	Also anyone can see who and when changed the files.
•	Issue part was very helpful for our team because we assigned tasks to every team members and trace them by issue tracking system.
•	Source part and its version management mechanism (log: who changed the source code, when, what is the change) was very nice.

Finally it is a good choice to use Google Code for CMPE 352’s project that covers important project management aspects and enable us to use them in an easy way.

2. I think our Project topic and content was very nice from the point of especially requirements and design phase. Because there were very details about the schematize (angles, configuration file, preservation criteria…etc) which gave us the opportunity to write detailed/grouped/subtitled requirements. Also, these details were nice from the aspect of design phase while thinking about the interactions, relationships, components. Although there were details, seeing the scope of the project, seeing the main components of the project was easy.

3. Yes, I want.

4. I think using Google code, working in a team, exchanging ideas, sharing the tasks, team communications were very valuable things for a project life in software engineering. On the other hand being at every cycle of the project (requirements, design, issue tracking…etc) ,communication with the customer, making project plans, producing some increments for specific milestones(milestone1:produce requirements,milestone2:produce scenario,milestone3:design diagrams…etc)  were very important things used in software engineering and CMPE 352’s project gave us the opportunity to deal all of them.
