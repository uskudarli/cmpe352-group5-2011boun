===System requirements===

====Functional requirements====
The following statements of services which our software provides, are defined to be reactions/behaviour of the program (ie. outputs, states) based on some specific (or probable) inputs; in our case those are mostly data calculation, processing and technical design. 

-can take input as 

text file: within each line 
<geographic location1><geographic location2>
<path1>(or google maps .kml file) configuration file(including angle) 

-gives output as various vectoral image format 

(additional exporting plugins) 

-real-time parsing for any changes done by user 

-@TODO background mode 

-updater 

-DBMS 

-creation wizard 

-reference helper 

====Non-functional requirements====
That kind of requirements unlike the functional requirements, will be applied on the whole system, not branches of the software. Non-functional requirements are crucial because of the fact that if any of those does not work in the way it supposed to, entire system may face a complete break-down. Hence they do not apply specific services/functions/behaviours listed above.
